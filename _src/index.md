Powered by `CMake`, the R package `cmaker` setups C/C++ develop
environment for R package, to enjoy auto-complete, code navigation,
parallel compiling and other features of IDE. Not convinced? Watch
Xcode in action and give it a try. If not satisfied, just delete
`CMakeList.txt`, `proj/` and `cmake`. Testing, suggestion, and pull
request are welcome.

# Usage

__The IDE project generated by `cmaker` is for development of R
package only. Always check and build R package following CRAN document
before release.__

You may copy the example from `cmaker` to set a playground with the
following R command

```r
file.copy(from = system.file("examples/rcppexample", package = "cmaker"),
          to = ".", recursive = TRUE)
```

- `ls_IDEs()` to get recommend IDEs for your system.
- `add_cmake("pkg_dir", language = "CXX", cxx_standard = "98",
  compileAttributes = TRUE)` to generate cmake files for the R
  package.
- `generate_project("pkg_dir", "IDE_name")` to generate project for your preferred IDE.
- Open IDE and enjoy.
- When you are ready, build within IDE.
- Call `load_asis("pkg_dir")` to load the package. `load_asis` works
  the same way as `devtools::load_all`, but assuming the dynamic
  library has been built properly.

# Install

__Windows is not supported yet due to complexity of compiling R packages in Windows. Will be supported soon. Please stay tuned.__

## System requirements

`cmaker` depends on [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) and
[ninja](https://martine.github.io/ninja/). The newest versions are
recommended.

- Mac users may install them
through [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) or
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), with command
```bash
port install cmake ninja
```
or
```
brew install cmake ninja
```
- Linux users may install them through package management tools. You
  may need [PPA](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas) or something similar to install the newest version.

## Install the package

`cmaker` require `devtools (>= 1.7.0.9000)`, which is not on CRAN
yet. Install newest `devtools` from github, and then install `cmaker`
from github. The following R script installs them automatically.

- Mac and Linux
```r
if (! "devtools" %in% installed.packages())
  install.packages("devtools")
if (packageVersion("devtools") < "1.7.0.9000") {
  ## The head of master branch is borken at time of writting.
  ## Install devtools 1.7.0.9000
  devtools::install_github("hadley/devtools", ref = "4d0964a1")
}
devtools::install_github("luckyrandom/cmaker")
```
